## ‚ö†Ô∏è Cons of Using RunPod in Southeast Asia

1. **Latency / Data Transfer Speeds**  
   Lack of local data centers could lead to higher latency or slower uploads/downloads.

2. **Payment & Currency Issues**  
   Priced in USD; potential foreign transaction fees and limited card access.

3. **No Localized Support or Community**  
   Limited local tutorials or SEA-specific resources.

4. **Lack of Local GPU Marketplace**  
   May not suit low-latency APIs targeting SEA users unless local regions are added.

5. **Data Privacy & Sovereignty**  
   Data stored/processed abroad may violate local laws in sensitive sectors (e.g., finance, health).
